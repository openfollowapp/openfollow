# Debian packaging (offline `.deb`)

OpenFollow ships as a self-contained Debian package. The primary target is
Raspberry Pi OS (`arm64`), and the same package is built for `amd64` so it also
installs on a commodity x86_64 Debian/Ubuntu host (mini-PC, NUC, laptop). The
`.deb` bundles the runtime **and all Python dependencies** in a private
virtualenv at `/opt/openfollow/venv`, so it installs and runs **with no
internet**. It installs the systemd service, the boot splash, and autostart, and
the `arm64` build is the input artifact for the `rpi-image-gen` appliance image
build (see [Appliance image](#appliance-image-rpi-image-gen); the appliance image
is Pi-only).

> Build time is online; install time is offline. The build resolves PyPI wheels
> and the `pypsn` git dependency and compiles any sdists, then bakes everything
> into the package. `dpkg -i` afterwards fetches nothing.

> **GObject-Introspection stack is the OS's, not bundled.** The venv is created
> with `--system-site-packages` and the pip-built `PyGObject`/`pycairo` are
> removed, so `gi` / GStreamer come from the distro packages (`python3-gi`,
> `python3-gi-cairo`, the `gir1.2-*` typelibs). Reason: pip
> resolves `PyGObject>=3.56` (the new **girepository-2.0** ABI), which Debian
> Trixie (`python3-gi 3.50` on `libgirepository-1.0-1`) cannot load –
> `ImportError: libgirepository-2.0.so.0`. Using the OS bindings keeps the
> bindings, the typelibs and `libgirepository` coherent. Everything else (numpy,
> pygame, bottle, mido, the openfollow package, …) is still bundled in the venv.
>
> **Do not add `python3-gst-1.0` to `Depends`.** Its `gi/overrides/Gst.py`
> makes `Gst.Caps.get_structure()` return a `StructureWrapper` that lacks
> `.get_value()`, so `video/receiver.py` and `video/detection.py` raise
> `AttributeError` reading frame width/height. The app targets the raw typelib
> `Gst.Structure` (which has `.get_value()`); the GStreamer Python *overrides*
> package is intentionally absent. Keep it uninstalled on the build host too,
> since the `--system-site-packages` venv would otherwise pick up its overrides.

## Files

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `packaging/build-deb.sh` | Builds the `.deb` (run natively on the target arch; `arch` comes from `dpkg --print-architecture`). |
| `packaging/debian/control.in` | Package metadata; `@VERSION@/@ARCH@/@PYTHON_DEP@/@ALSA_DEP@` are filled in by the build from the build host. |
| `packaging/debian/openfollow.service` | Main systemd unit (Cage Wayland kiosk, runs the bundled venv). |
| `packaging/debian/openfollow-splash.service` + `splash.sh` | Boot splash unit + KMS launcher. |
| `packaging/debian/render-splash.sh` | Pre-renders the splash PNG at build time. |
| `packaging/debian/{postinst,prerm,postrm}` | Create the `openfollow` user + linger, enable/disable the units. |
| `.github/workflows/release-deb.yml` | Release CI: builds the `.deb`, signs it into an `.ofupdate` bundle, and attaches both to the release – natively per arch on GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-24.04-arm` (arm64) and `ubuntu-24.04` (amd64) runners (each inside a `debian:trixie` container). |

## Install layout

```
/opt/openfollow/venv/                      all Python deps + the openfollow package (incl. the detection backend: onnxruntime + opencv)
/usr/lib/systemd/system/openfollow.service
/usr/lib/systemd/system/openfollow-splash.service
/usr/share/openfollow/{openfollow.svg,splash.png,splash.sh,config.example.toml,install-ndi.sh,install-detection.sh}
/usr/share/openfollow/scripts/export_onnx.py   model-export script (Download Model action shells out to it)
/usr/share/openfollow/models/{yolo26n,yolo26s,yolo26m}.onnx   pre-shipped quality tiers (Fastest/Fast/Balanced)
/var/lib/openfollow/                       service user home + WorkingDirectory (config.toml)
/var/lib/openfollow/config.example.toml    first-boot seed; bootstrap copies it to config.toml
```

The example is shipped into `/var/lib/openfollow/` (not just `/usr/share`) because
`bootstrap_config_if_missing` looks for it next to `config.toml` – the
WorkingDirectory – so a fresh device seeds the curated config on first boot
instead of falling back to bare dataclass defaults.

The Pi-appropriate quality tiers (Fastest / Fast / Balanced) are exported at
build time into `/usr/share/openfollow/models/`; on first start the app seeds them
into the detection storage `models/` folder (`openfollow/model_seed.py`, called
from `init_video`) so detection works offline out of the box. The heavier
Accurate / XLarge tiers are Advanced downloads (a Pi can't run them well). The
export runs in a throwaway venv so torch/ultralytics never enter the `.deb`; it
needs an uplink, so set `OF_DEB_SKIP_MODELS=1` to build on an offline host.

The service runs as a dedicated `openfollow` login user (created by `postinst`)
with `loginctl enable-linger` so `/run/user/<uid>` exists at boot for the Cage
Wayland session. The unit binds web port 80 via `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`.

## Build it

Run **on the target architecture** – the venv embeds the build host's Python ABI,
so an `arm64` package only runs on `arm64` and an `amd64` one only on `amd64`
(no cross-compile). CI builds both natively as a two-leg matrix: `ubuntu-24.04-arm`
(arm64) and `ubuntu-24.04` (amd64), each inside a `debian:trixie` container so the
venv's Python (3.13) matches the Trixie image; the `ubuntu-24.04` hosts themselves
ship Python 3.12.

```bash
# Build prerequisites (CI installs these automatically):
sudo bash scripts/install-system-deps.sh
sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv python3-dev build-essential pkg-config \
  dpkg-dev libgirepository-2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libasound2-dev \
  python3-cairo gir1.2-rsvg-2.0 librsvg2-bin

bash packaging/build-deb.sh            # -> dist/openfollow_<version>_<arch>.deb
```

The version comes from `pyproject.toml` (`0.2.3rc6` → Debian `0.2.3~rc6`, so a
pre-release sorts before the final release). Override with `OF_DEB_VERSION=…`.

## Install it (offline)

On a host whose base OS already provides the `Depends` (GStreamer, GTK, Cage,
seatd, kanshi, the `gir1.2-*` typelibs, …) – a Pi, or an x86_64 machine on the
same OS release:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y ./openfollow_*.deb   # or: sudo dpkg -i ./openfollow_*.deb
```

The target must run **Debian 13 (Trixie) / Python 3.13** (Raspberry Pi OS is
Trixie-based): the bundled venv is stamped `python3 (>= 3.13), (<< 3.14)`, so an
older-Python host (Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 12) refuses the install. The service is a
Cage/DRM kiosk, so the machine also needs a GPU + display – it will not come up on
a headless server / VM.

`postinst` creates the user, enables linger, and starts the service. Open the
web UI at `http://<host-ip>/`.

> In a chroot/image-build context (no running systemd), the maintainer scripts
> enable the units but skip the live start – exactly what `rpi-image-gen` needs.

## Release flow

`.github/workflows/release-deb.yml` triggers on a published GitHub Release (or
`workflow_dispatch`) and builds one leg per architecture on GitHub-hosted
`ubuntu-24.04-arm` (arm64) and `ubuntu-24.04` (amd64) runners (each in a
`debian:trixie` container). Each leg wraps its `.deb` in a **signed update bundle**
and attaches both the bundle and the raw `.deb` to the release, so a release
carries `arm64` and `amd64` variants side by side.

The bundle `openfollow_<version>_<arch>.ofupdate` is a plain tar of three members:
the `.deb`, a `SHA256SUMS` line for it, and `SHA256SUMS.sig` – an openssl RSA
signature over the checksum, made with the release private key
(`OPENFOLLOW_RELEASE_PRIVKEY` Actions secret). The matching public key ships in
the package (`openfollow/runtime/release-pubkey.pem`); the device verifies the
signature and checksum before installing (see the in-app updater below).

Both are release assets: the signed `.ofupdate` is what the in-app updater
downloads and verifies, while the raw `openfollow_<version>_<arch>.deb` is
attached for a one-step manual `apt`/`dpkg` install (trusted via GitHub/HTTPS,
like the appliance images). Older releases that shipped only the bundle can have
the `.deb` extracted from it:

```bash
tar xf openfollow_<version>_<arch>.ofupdate openfollow_<version>_<arch>.deb
```

## Appliance image (rpi-image-gen)

The appliance image is **Pi-only** (arm64): x86_64 hosts are supported through the
`amd64` `.deb` / `.ofupdate` alone, not a flashable image.

For a turnkey deploy, the `arm64` `.deb` is baked into a flashable **Raspberry Pi
OS Lite (Trixie, arm64) image**, built with
[`rpi-image-gen`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-image-gen). The image boots
headless straight into the Cage Wayland kiosk. Two board targets are built from the
**same `.deb`, the same custom layer, and a shared base config** – each per-board
config just includes the common base and overrides the device layer + image name:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `packaging/image/config/openfollow-common.yaml` | Shared base config (not built directly): the `openfollow` account, image size, custom layer, and `.deb` path – everything both boards have in common. |
| `packaging/image/config/openfollow-cm5.yaml` | Build config: **CM5** device (`rpi-cm5` layer, 16 GB eMMC defaults). Includes the common base; overrides only the device layer + image name. |
| `packaging/image/config/openfollow-pi5.yaml` | Build config: **standard Pi 5** device (`rpi5` layer, SD-card default). Includes the common base; overrides only the device layer + image name. |
| `packaging/image/layer/openfollow.yaml` | Custom layer (shared): installs the `.deb` (apt resolves its `Depends` from the Pi OS repos), applies the headless boot config, enables SSH. |

**What the image adds over the `.deb`** (OS/boot concerns the `.deb` deliberately
does not own): silent kiosk boot (`cmdline.txt` console → tty3 + `quiet`,
`disable_splash=1`), HDMI pinned to 1920×1080@60 (DMT), `dtoverlay=disable-wifi` +
`disable-bt`, `getty@tty1` masked, and the SSH server enabled.

**Network stack: NetworkManager.** The layer installs and enables `network-manager`
(and masks `systemd-networkd`) instead of relying on the stock `systemd-net-min`
layer. OpenFollow's in-app Network page configures interfaces through `nmcli`, so
NetworkManager must own the links – on a `systemd-networkd` image the `nmcli` binary
is absent, the privilege broker's `network.nm.*` rows read as `unavailable`, and the
Network page silently falls back to a read-only view. This also matches the Ansible
deploy path, which already assumes NetworkManager. The `.deb`'s
`NetworkManager-wait-online` timeout drop-in bounds a cable-less boot to ~15 s.

**Single account.** `rpi-image-gen`'s `rpi-user-credentials` layer creates the
`openfollow` login user (password `openfollow`, **passwordless sudo**, in the
`video/render/input/audio/plugdev/dialout/sudo` groups) *before* the `.deb`
installs, so the deb's `postinst` finds it and only adds linger + enables the
units. That one account is **both** the SSH maintenance login and the Cage kiosk
service user. **Change the default password on a production unit.**

### Build it

Run natively on arm64 (CI uses a GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner directly
– no container, since `rpi-image-gen`/`mmdebstrap` bootstrap a Trixie rootfs
regardless of host). `rpi-image-gen` is cloned at a pinned ref; the build is
online (apt pulls the deb's `Depends`), the result is offline.

```bash
cp dist/openfollow_*_arm64.deb packaging/image/openfollow.deb
git clone --depth 1 --branch v2.6.0 \
  https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-image-gen ~/rpi-image-gen
sudo ~/rpi-image-gen/install_deps.sh
cd ~/rpi-image-gen
# CM5 (eMMC):
./rpi-image-gen build -S /path/to/repo/packaging/image -c openfollow-cm5.yaml
# -> work/image-openfollow-cm5/openfollow-cm5.img (+ a zstd copy under deploy-*/)
# Standard Pi 5 (SD card):
./rpi-image-gen build -S /path/to/repo/packaging/image -c openfollow-pi5.yaml
# -> work/image-openfollow-pi5/openfollow-pi5.img
```

### Flash it (CM5 eMMC)

The CM5's eMMC is not removable, so flash it over USB with
[`rpiboot`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot): put the carrier in eMMC-boot
mode (nRPIBOOT jumper / `rpiboot -d`), then write the image to the exposed block
device with `rpi-imager` or `dd`. The rootfs auto-expands to fill the eMMC on
first boot.

### Flash it (standard Pi 5, SD card)

Write `openfollow-pi5_<version>.img.xz` to a microSD card with **Raspberry Pi
Imager** (**Choose OS → Use custom**) or `dd`, then boot the Pi 5 from it. The
rootfs auto-expands to fill the card on first boot.

### Root reference (boots by filesystem UUID)

`cmdline.txt` references the root filesystem as `root=UUID=<root-fs-uuid>` and
`/etc/fstab` mounts root and `/boot/firmware` by `UUID=` as well. UUID references
ride the stock `/dev/disk/by-uuid/*` udev links, which are created unconditionally
and resolved by `initramfs-tools` before the root mounts, and a UUID is identical
across boot media (SD / eMMC / NVMe). The `rpi-image-gen` image layout defaults to
`/dev/disk/by-slot/*` symlinks, which depend on a boot-device-gated udev rule
running early in the initramfs; when that rule does not resolve (Pi 5), the kernel
never finds root and boot drops to the initramfs rescue shell. Two SRCROOT hooks
override it: `packaging/image/pre-image.sh` chains
`packaging/image/openfollow-root-ref.sh` onto each `genimage` `exec-pre`, and that
script rewrites the by-slot references to the build's own `ROOT_UUID` / `BOOT_UUID`
(from `img_uuids`). The rewrite fails the build loudly if a by-slot reference ever
survives, so a changed upstream layout can't silently ship an image that boots to a
shell. Guarded by `tests/test_image_root_ref.py`.

### NVMe storage (auto-mount, presence-gated)

The CM5 ships an NVMe **slot**, not a guaranteed drive. A first-boot oneshot
(`openfollow-mount-nvme.service`, defined in `layer/openfollow.yaml` hook 2d)
handles whatever it finds, with an empty slot as an ordinary, fully supported
configuration:

- **No drive** – the unit's `ConditionPathExistsGlob=/dev/nvme*` makes systemd
  skip it cleanly; the appliance boots and runs from eMMC. Never an error, never
  a boot stall.
- **Drive with an existing filesystem** – mounted as-is at `/mnt/nvme`,
  persisted by-UUID in `/etc/fstab` with `nofail` (so a later drive removal
  can't block boot). The drive is **never reformatted**.
- **Truly blank drive** (no partition table, no filesystem, no on-disk
  signatures) – provisioned with a GPT label + a single ext4 partition, then
  mounted. The blank check is conservative: a drive that carries any
  partition/signature but nothing mountable is left untouched, not wiped.

On a mounted drive the hook creates `/mnt/nvme/openfollow/yolo/{models,cache}`
owned by the `openfollow` service user. Detection storage auto-resolves to
`/mnt/nvme/openfollow/yolo` whenever `/mnt/nvme` is mounted, else to a `yolo`
folder under the service working directory (`/var/lib/openfollow/yolo`) – see
`resolve_detection_storage_path`. There is no per-unit config edit and no web
field: storage is fully automatic (an absolute `detection.storage_path` in
`config.toml` still overrides). This mirrors the Ansible deploy's mount layout
(`scripts/ansible/install-raspberry-pi.yml`, `mount_nvme`).

### Release flow (CI)

`.github/workflows/release-deb.yml` builds the images in an `image` job that
`needs: build` and fans out over a `target: [cm5, pi5]` matrix. Each leg runs on
its own GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner – so the two boards build in
parallel with an isolated `$RUNNER_TEMP` – downloads the `openfollow-deb-arm64`
artifact from the same run (the arm64 build leg; the image is Pi-only), clones
`rpi-image-gen` at the pinned `v2.6.0`, builds
`openfollow-<target>.yaml`, compresses to `.img.xz`, uploads it as the
`openfollow-image-<target>` workflow artifact, and (on a published release)
attaches it to the GitHub Release next to the `.ofupdate` bundle.

### Software BOM (SBOM)

`rpi-image-gen` ships an `sbom-base` layer (pulled in transitively by the image
layer) that runs [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) over the finished
rootfs on every build. That single scan catalogues **both** the apt/dpkg OS
packages **and** the Python packages in the bundled `/opt/openfollow/venv` – so
it is the authoritative list of every piece of software actually on the image,
with versions and declared licenses. Each `image` matrix leg collects its own and
attaches **`openfollow-<target>_<version>.spdx.json`** (SPDX 2.3 JSON) to the
GitHub Release alongside the `.img.xz`, and uploads it as the
`openfollow-sbom-<target>` workflow artifact on every run. It is the
machine-readable companion to the curated
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). The detection **backend**
(`onnxruntime` + `opencv`) is bundled in the venv, so it appears in the SBOM; the
AGPL model-**export** toolchain (`ultralytics` / `torch`) is not installed in the
image and is documented in the notices instead.

### Compliance gate

The release is gated on that SBOM. After it is collected,
[`packaging/image/check_sbom_compliance.py`](../packaging/image/check_sbom_compliance.py)
scans it and **fails the build before either release-attach** if it finds:

- **NDI** anywhere, by package name – the proprietary NDI SDK/plugin, whose
  license metadata is unreliable.
- **The model-export toolchain** (`ultralytics`) bundled in the **venv** – it is
  AGPL-3.0 and only needed to *export* models on a workstation, never at show
  time. The inference **backend** (`onnxruntime` + `opencv`) is bundled on purpose
  – both are permissively licensed – so detection runs on an offline Pi with no
  pip; the gate scopes to venv (pypi) packages, so a transitive copy in the OS
  media stack (Debian's `gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad` pulls `libonnxruntime`) never
  trips it.

There is **no blanket AGPL-license gate**: OpenFollow itself is
AGPL-3.0-or-later, so AGPL is the image's own license, not a forbidden one. The
Debian operating system it sits beside is an independent work combined on the
same medium (mere aggregation, predominantly GPL-2.0). This proves "the AGPL
export toolchain and NDI are not shipped" is enforced, not just intended, and
keeps the proprietary NDI code out of the image. The accepted, redistributable
Raspberry Pi GPU firmware blob is proprietary but is **not** flagged.

## Removed: in-app git updater

The old web "Update From Source" updater (git pull + `poetry install` + restart)
has been **removed entirely** – the signed-`.deb` release installer is now the
sole update path. (It was already inert on a `.deb` install, where `/opt/openfollow`
is not a git checkout.)

The in-app updater is the **GitHub Releases signed-bundle installer**
([`openfollow/runtime/deb_update.py`](../openfollow/runtime/deb_update.py)): the
General → **Software Update** section's *Check & Install Latest* downloads the
newest release's `openfollow_<version>_<arch>.ofupdate` bundle, and *Offline
install* takes an operator-supplied `.ofupdate` over the LAN. Both paths verify
the bundle's signature (against the on-device public key) and the `.deb`'s
SHA-256 before installing, and fail closed otherwise. See
[`SERVICE.md`](./SERVICE.md#web-update-button) for the install/privilege details.

## macOS `.dmg` (developer build)

A self-contained macOS app for **workstation / development** use, not show
deployment (the Raspberry Pi `.deb` / image remain the production targets). The
`.dmg` bundles everything – Python, the GTK / GStreamer / GObject / Cairo / Rsvg
native stack, the detection inference backend (`onnxruntime` + `opencv`), and the
model-export toolchain (`ultralytics` + `torch`) – so it runs on a clean Mac with
nothing pre-installed.

### Files (macOS)

Everything lives under [`packaging/macos/`](../packaging/macos/):

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `build-dmg.sh` | Orchestrates icon → quality-tier models → PyInstaller → ad-hoc sign → self-check → DMG. |
| `openfollow.spec` | PyInstaller spec (collects the native stack + detection/export extras + every bundled `models/*.onnx`). |
| `launcher.py` | Bundle entry point: `--export` re-exec, `OPENFOLLOW_SELFCHECK`, and the GUI (seeds per-user config + all quality-tier models on first run). |
| `runtime_hook.py` | Points `GI_TYPELIB_PATH` / `GST_PLUGIN_PATH` / GdkPixbuf / GTK theme paths at the bundle before `gi` loads. |
| `config.seed.toml` | First-run config (binds the web UI to port 8080, enables detection). |
| `make-icns.sh` | Renders the `.icns` from `openfollow/web/static/icon.svg`. |

### Build it (macOS)

```bash
# One-time host tools (in addition to the documented macOS dev setup):
brew install librsvg create-dmg

make dmg            # -> dist/OpenFollow-<version>-<arch>.dmg
```

`make dmg` is macOS-only, installs the optional `package-macos` Poetry group plus
the `detection` + `export` extras, then runs `build-dmg.sh`. The build host needs
an uplink (torch / ultralytics wheels + the five YOLO26 tier weights). The output is
**single-arch** (matches the build host; an Intel `.dmg` needs an Intel build
host). It is **large** because of torch – on Apple Silicon the `.app` is ~900 MB
and the compressed `.dmg` ~350 MB.

A post-build self-check runs the frozen app with a scrubbed environment
(`env -i HOME=$HOME OPENFOLLOW_SELFCHECK=1 …`) and fails the build unless the
bundled `gi` / GStreamer elements and the detection deps all resolve from inside
the `.app`.

### Build internals (when the native stack breaks)

Freezing a relocated Homebrew GTK / GStreamer tree alongside torch / opencv hits
three native-library traps. Each has a guard that fails the build loudly rather
than shipping a bundle that crashes on launch, so a future spec edit that
regresses one is caught at build time:

- **Analysis-time dyld resolution.** PyInstaller's `gi` hooks resolve
  `libgio` / `libgobject` / `librsvg` / `libgstapp` through `macholib`, which does
  not search the Homebrew prefix. `build-dmg.sh` exports
  `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` to the brew lib dir so the freeze can find them.
- **Vendored-dylib shadowing.** The `cv2`, `pygame`, `Pillow`, and `matplotlib`
  wheels each vendor an older `libglib` / `libintl` / `libharfbuzz` /
  `libfreetype` / `libfontconfig` under `<pkg>/.dylibs/`. PyInstaller dedups
  shared libs by basename, so a vendored copy can win and shadow the newer
  Homebrew build the GObject / pango stack needs (`g_string_copy`,
  `_hb_coretext_font_create`). `build-dmg.sh` prunes those vendored copies before
  the freeze (and swaps `opencv-python` → `opencv-python-headless`); the spec
  asserts every collected `libglib` / `libharfbuzz` comes from a Homebrew source.
- **GStreamer plugin scan.** The `gi` Gst hook collects all 270+ Homebrew
  plugins, including `gst-plugins-rs` ones that embed a Python runtime; GStreamer
  `dlopen`/`dlclose`s every plugin during its registry scan, and one of those
  `dlclose`s runs a matplotlib static destructor with the GIL released → a fatal
  abort in `Gst.init()`. The spec keeps an allowlist of the standard C plugins
  OpenFollow actually uses (and asserts the critical ones – `gtk`, `applemedia`,
  `videoconvertscale`, `videotestsrc`, `imagefreeze` – survive), and
  `runtime_hook.py` pins the versioned `GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH_1_0` to the
  bundle's `gst_plugins/` dir so the scan can't recurse into `Frameworks/` and
  pick up `*.cpython-*.so` extension modules as would-be plugins.
- **Dynamically imported Python modules.** PyInstaller's static analysis only
  follows literal `import` statements, so modules pulled in by a runtime string
  are dropped. OpenFollow has three such surfaces: the video input plugins
  (discovered by walking `openfollow.video.inputs` with `pkgutil`), the bottle
  templates (`% from openfollow.<mod> import …` at render time), and `mido`'s
  MIDI backend. A partial collection is the nastiest failure mode here because it
  passes a naive smoke test: the app launches, then crash-loops on the first
  `init_video` (`Unknown video input type: 'testpattern'`) or 500s on the first
  web request (`No module named 'openfollow.web.labels'`). The spec collects the
  whole `openfollow` package plus the `mido.backends` / `rtmidi` modules, and the
  `OPENFOLLOW_SELFCHECK` step asserts the full input-plugin registry resolves and
  every template-imported submodule imports – so a regression fails the build.

### Models

- All five YOLO26 quality tiers (`yolo26{n,s,m,l,x}.onnx`, exported at imgsz 640)
  are generated at build time and seeded into
  `~/Library/Application Support/OpenFollow/yolo/models/` on first launch
  (`launcher.seed_user_data` copies every bundled `.onnx`), so detection runs
  immediately at any quality tier with no download. The seed config defaults the
  Mac to the Balanced tier (`yolo26m.onnx`).
- The web UI **Person Detection → Models → Advanced → Download model** action works from the
  installed app. Because the frozen `sys.executable` is the app (not a Python
  interpreter), the export route re-execs the app in `--export` mode and runs
  `export_onnx` in-process (see `_build_export_argv` in
  [`openfollow/web/routes.py`](../openfollow/web/routes.py)). This is the **same
  operator-clicked, online model-export action** the offline-runtime contract
  already allows as an exception – the desktop bundle just makes it functional.
  It is never on the show data path.
- A Finder-launched `.app` runs with a **read-only working directory** (`/`), and
  ultralytics downloads the `.pt` weights into the cwd. So the launcher's
  `run_export` `chdir`s into the writable storage root
  (`~/Library/Application Support/OpenFollow/yolo/`) and pins
  `YOLO_CONFIG_DIR` / `MPLCONFIGDIR` / `XDG_CACHE_HOME` under it before exporting.

### Signing / Gatekeeper

The `.app` is **ad-hoc signed, not notarized**. macOS quarantines it on first
download, so the operator must clear the quarantine flag once:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/OpenFollow.app"
# or: right-click the app -> Open -> Open
```

Notarization (Developer ID + `notarytool` + stapling) and a CI `macos` release
job are tracked follow-ups.

### On-device "Open Web UI"

The Settings-menu **Open Web UI** action opens the local web UI
(`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`) in the system default browser via `open`. The
embedded WebKitGTK overlay used on Linux/Pi is **not** available on macOS – the
Homebrew `webkitgtk` port renders through X11/Wayland (incompatible with the
native Quartz GTK window) and ships no bottle – so nothing WebKit-related is
bundled. The web server is unchanged and also reachable from any browser on the

### Not bundled

**NDI** is excluded from the macOS bundle. The proprietary NDI SDK (`libndi`) and
the `ndisrc` GStreamer plugin (`libgstndi`) are pruned in `openfollow.spec` – the
SDK would otherwise be redistributed, and the spec now asserts neither survives so
a transitive re-add fails the build. With no `ndisrc` element,
`NdiInput.is_available()` is False, so **NDI does not appear in the source picker
on the Mac app**. (Discovery can't be made to work against a system NDI Tools
install either: the bundle's GStreamer scan is confined to its own `gst_plugins/`,
so a system `ndisrc` is never picked up.) NDI input remains available on the
Raspberry Pi build; receiving NDI on macOS would need a separate, NDI-licensed
build, which is out of scope for the developer DMG.
